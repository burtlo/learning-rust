# Learning Rust via Ruby

### A text-based adventure game being built in Rust and Ruby (simultaneously)

If you want to play it:

1. clone this repository
2. cd into it (i.e. enter `cd learning-rust` in your terminal)
3. for the Ruby version: enter `ruby lib/main.rb` in your terminal and hit return. For the Rust version: enter `cargo run` in your terminal and hit return
4. play :)

The actual narrative still needs to be ported over & some prettifying still needs to happen, but you can play a super simplistic placeholder game right now. Both games should basically work at this point, but please submit an issue if you notice something's broken! The Ruby side seems to be especially fragile.

Built mostly by @lbaillie with help from @wycats
